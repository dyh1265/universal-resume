About:
- Ph.D. in Computer Science
- University of Heidelberg | Data Science, ML, AI, Computer Vision
- As a researcher, I was focused on causal inference and individualized treatment effect estimation with deep learning. I also worked on explainable AI for healthcare and vision tasks. Permanent residency and full work authorization in Germany. Open to relocation.

Research interests:
- Causal inference, individualized treatment assignment, explainable ML
- Built and evaluated deep learning models (MLPs, GANs, VAEs, GNNs) in TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch for healthcare decision support, privacy, and explainability.
